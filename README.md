# image-processing-and-segmentation
This research presents an IoT-based plant health monitoring system that analyzes leaf greenness—an indicator of chlorophyll content—to detect stress, nutrient deficiencies, or disease. Plant images are captured and processed to extract RGB values, focusing on green intensity. Techniques like HSV(Hue Saturation Value) filtering and segmentation to improve accuracy by isolating leaf pixels and removing background noise, with significant differences observed in green percentage before and after segmentation. To suit low-power IoT devices, the system uses lightweight image processing and transmits the results to a central server for real-time monitoring and decision-making, supporting data-driven precision agriculture.
