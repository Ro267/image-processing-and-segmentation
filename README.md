# image-processing-and-segmentation
This study presents an IoT-based health monitoring system which analyses leaf greenness- an indicator of chlorophyll content to detect	 stress, nutritional deficiency and diseases. Plant images were captured by a drone with an ESP32-CAM attached to it. Then the captured images were processed using python to extract RGB values and later focused on green intensity. Techniques like HSV filtering and segmentation improved the accuracy by isolating leaf pixels and removing background noise with significant differences observed in green percentage. The system made use of light weighted image processing and transmitted the results to central server for real-time monitoring and analysis. This would support data-driven precision agriculture.
